Introduction to Computer Graphics (WebGL)

This repository features all of the projects that I made independently throughout the course CSE160. 

General Overview:
Lab0 - Vector Math Calculator
Lab1 - Simple Drawing Tool
Lab2 - Blocky Animal
Lab3 - Blocky World
Lab4 - Lighting 

To make these projects, I used a WebGL canvas and an HTML page to display the projects.
